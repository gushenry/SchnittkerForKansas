									<h2>About Mark</h2>

									<p>"It is past time to restore common sense to Topeka. Governor Brownback and his hand-picked legislators have done immeasurable damage to our great schools, our Kansas economy, and our state's reputation. The Governor's income tax reductions have shifted the tax burden to working Kansans in the form of sales and property taxes, while lining the pockets of his powerful contributors and friends. At the end of the day, this tax policy has also led to massive revenue shortfalls. This lack of revenue will certainly lead to school consolidations. Teachers who were recently blindsided by the Republicans' late night ploy to do away with teacher due process - which allowed teachers to teach rather than worry about how popular they were with school board members - will then find themselves out of work or relocated. It is no secret that the 114th district has more than one school that would likely be affected by these consolidations."</p>

                                    <p>The son of a public school teacher and farmer, Mark believes protecting Kansas’ tradition of strong public schools should be the state’s top priority. “My opponent has helped the governor undermine our great schools repeatedly, attacking our teachers and pushing extreme partisan policy measures that will only weaken our schools. I pledge to listen to the parents, educators and all constituents of the 114th and fight to do what is best for our communities, our schools and the future of Kansas.”</p>

                                    <p>Mark grew up on a farm in southwest Kingman County and now lives in the city of Kingman with his wife Helen. Mark and Helen together have a blended family with six adult children. Mark himself has two sons and two daughters, and is known as a kind, generous person, always making time for others - especially children and the elderly. Mark is a member of St. Patrick’s Parish and the Knights of Columbus. In his free time, he enjoys fishing and traveling. Mark has been employed with Kingman County as Director of Facilities for the past nine years.</p>
