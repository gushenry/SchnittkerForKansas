									<h2>Learn the Issues</h2>
                                    
                                    <h3 id="education">Education</h3>

									<p>This is the #1 priority issue for Mark Schnittker.  Mark supported passing a clean bill to fully fund our state’s public education system.  He did NOT support the bill that his opponent voted for which included stripping teacher due process while giving tax breaks to wealthy individuals and companies to fund scholarships to private schools, depleting funds from our public schools.</p>
                                    <p>Mark understands the importance of a constitutionally mandated, properly and equitably funded public education system that benefits ALL Kansas tax paying families.  The business community also realizes the importance of this issue in producing competent, educated Kansans to assure a pool of qualified future employees and business owners.</p><br />
                                    
                                    <h3 id="tax-fairness">Tax Fairness</h3>
                                    
									<p>Mark knows that the 3-legged stool model that provides balanced revenues from state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes is best for the financial soundness of Kansas and all our citizens.  This model, previously a respected bi-partisan structure, provides adequate funding for public education, roads and transportation, social services, law enforcement and emergency services, etc.</p>
                                    <p>Governor Brownback and his hand-picked legislators voted to COMPLETELY ELIMINATE income taxes for LLC’s, Subchapter-S Corporations and sole proprietorships and to substantially reduce the rates of our wealthiest Kansas citizens.  This creates an unfair burden on salaried and hourly employees that are often the hardest working, lowest income Kansans.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, this shift in taxation is already resulting in higher property taxes, school district mill levies and sales taxes for all Kansans.</p><br />
                                    
                                    <h3 id="medicaid">Medicaid Expansion</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>All over the state our uninsured numbers continue to rise. Local businesses are crying out. Our Rural hospitals are in jeopardy.  New badly needed medical equipment cannot be purchased. Our Legislators must act now. To totally ignore solutions that would enhance Kansas, create 5000 jobs, and cut uninsured by over 50% is unacceptable.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is a legislator's responsibility to put aside politics and do what he or she was elected to do in the first place - "Putting Kansans First".  Governor Brownback and his allies simply don't care about the poor and disadvantaged. Mark will listen to our business leaders. It is time to elect legislators that are ready to step up and accept the challenge. We must protect our Kansans.</p><br />
                                    
                                    <h3 id="opportunity">Opportunity</h3>

									<p>Kansans love their state and want to see common sense restored to our government.  Mark will fight for policies that will help our economy to grow, not shrink, creating more revenues to maintain and rebuild our infrastructure and schools.  A stable and prospering Kansas will create more jobs and opportunities for business and economic development.  This is in stark contrast to Gov. Brownback and his hand-picked legislators’ policies of CUT, CUT, CUT to essential services.  Their politics of outsourcing state government jobs to private out-of-state, for-profit companies further eats away at Kansas jobs.</p>
                                    <p>Voting rights are extremely important to Mark as well.  His team is working hard to get every suspended voter in the 114th District qualified to vote by the Nov. 4th General Election.  Mark will continue working to protect our right to vote, giving us all the opportunity to participate and be heard.</p><br />
                                    
                                    <h3 id="fiscal-responsibility">Fiscal Responsibility</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>Back to the 3-legged stool model, we are now seeing the evidence of serious imbalance with our state budget.  Revenues from state income taxes are well below the Governor’s projections for the months of April and May.  The stool is leaning and about to tip over with the loss of the stable leg of state income taxes.  This is recently exemplified by Kansas having to borrow $675 Million to stay afloat.  In addition, our state’s credit rating was downgraded by the rating agencies.</p>
                                    <p>Mark will work to restore balance and common sense to the budget of our great state of Kansas.  If Kansas prospers, we all prosper.</p>
